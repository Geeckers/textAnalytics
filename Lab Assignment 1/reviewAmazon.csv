Zachary Woodman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023","I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.

Ken,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","I had the Soundcore by Anker Life Q35 ANC Headphones. I liked them. ANC was great. and while stock they were a little bass boomy, they EQed out just fine. The only issue I had was at the 1 year point, the plastic it was made out of started falling apart. I had 3 pieces of the headset fall apart until it finally broke enough that I couldn't wear them. I tried supergluing them, but they weren't really stable on my head. Still sounded good though.Since I liked the Q35s so much, I decided to get the Q45s. I agonized over the Q45 vs the cheaper space one, but decided to get the Q45s when they were on sale and the Ones were not. When I got them they seemed like they were made better, so I was just going to be careful using them. Then I listened to them.The Q45s tweeters hurt my ears. I tried EQing the treble down and it just sounds muffled. I switched to the Q35s thinking I was just imagining things and the treble didn’t hurt at all. I tried turning the treble up and while it sounded like there was too much treble, it still didn’t hurt my ears. I returned them.My next pick was this Sony WH-CH720N because it had physical buttons. I've used touch select and really didn't like it. I'm totally team physical buttons. The ANC isn't as good as the Q35, but it's good enough. The tweaters don't hurt my ears, and it sounds great. The battery life is like the Q35s. A couple all day listening. It's not as good as the q45, but it's not short.What's amazing is the headphone weight and comfort. I didn't even know you could get over the ear headphones with ANC so light. I forget they are on, they are so light. I can totally recommend these.

The battery life is amazing the sound is nice and tight. One thing about these is that they make a soft popping sound coming from the diaphragm when you adjust them or move them once wearing them. I suppose that it’s from the vacuum they create for the noise cancellation. I give this a good solid purchase for the money because they are solid and the sound is great! 4.5/5

Coming from Bose QC35, I was a bit disappointed in the lesser noise cancellation, but these are a third of the price and do good enough. Sound quality is on par if not better than $300+ headphones.

Sound quality is excellent, comfortable, and a very good microphone for voice calling (call clarity on the other end is better than Anker Soundcore LIfe 30).  Noise cancelling is acceptable.  I do wish this had raised buttons and had skip forward/backward feature.  It also has a wired connection which is nice.  Battery life is good haven't had to recharge often.  Has a robust app and a handy widget.  Automatic power off is a nice feature.

Noise cancelling isn't the best, but I'm happy with them (probably just need to turn the volume up). Lightweight and attractive.

Zachary Woodman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023","I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.

Ken,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","I had the Soundcore by Anker Life Q35 ANC Headphones. I liked them. ANC was great. and while stock they were a little bass boomy, they EQed out just fine. The only issue I had was at the 1 year point, the plastic it was made out of started falling apart. I had 3 pieces of the headset fall apart until it finally broke enough that I couldn't wear them. I tried supergluing them, but they weren't really stable on my head. Still sounded good though.Since I liked the Q35s so much, I decided to get the Q45s. I agonized over the Q45 vs the cheaper space one, but decided to get the Q45s when they were on sale and the Ones were not. When I got them they seemed like they were made better, so I was just going to be careful using them. Then I listened to them.The Q45s tweeters hurt my ears. I tried EQing the treble down and it just sounds muffled. I switched to the Q35s thinking I was just imagining things and the treble didn’t hurt at all. I tried turning the treble up and while it sounded like there was too much treble, it still didn’t hurt my ears. I returned them.My next pick was this Sony WH-CH720N because it had physical buttons. I've used touch select and really didn't like it. I'm totally team physical buttons. The ANC isn't as good as the Q35, but it's good enough. The tweaters don't hurt my ears, and it sounds great. The battery life is like the Q35s. A couple all day listening. It's not as good as the q45, but it's not short.What's amazing is the headphone weight and comfort. I didn't even know you could get over the ear headphones with ANC so light. I forget they are on, they are so light. I can totally recommend these.

The battery life is amazing the sound is nice and tight. One thing about these is that they make a soft popping sound coming from the diaphragm when you adjust them or move them once wearing them. I suppose that it’s from the vacuum they create for the noise cancellation. I give this a good solid purchase for the money because they are solid and the sound is great! 4.5/5
